# UFOs
## Purpose
We were brought in to create a website that holds a record of reported UFO sightings and allowq those to be sorted based on a variety of filters.
The website was to be accessably formatted to allow readers to quickly and easily sort the sighting records by date, location, and type of ship. 

## Results

When we open the page initially, we are greeted with a list of sightings as well as search bars with mock searches prefilled.

a reader can input their desired filters into those boxes and the results will filter to the chosen attributes. In the above image, we have filtered for "triangle" shaped ships. 

## Summary

This website effectively allows users to filter the data and find the sightings that match any criteria they desire. 

One drawback with the design we have come up with is that the filters are, sometimes, somewhat difficult for a reader to know. For example, there are hundreds of countries in the world, and only a small number of them are included in our list. Perhaps a dropdown menu rather than an empty field would be ideal for the fields with only a few distinct categories. 

Additionally, allowing for a range of dates rather than a specific date could be very valuable, for reasons similar to those outlined above: if one wanted to see all of the sightings for October, they would need to manually go thorugh and check each date in the month, one at a time. This could be made more efficient.
